Project Description:

The project is a social media-like web application called "Recipees" that allows users to create and share recipes with each other. The application is built using React on the frontend and Node.js with Express on the backend, utilizing MySQL as the database for storing user information and recipe data.

Key Features:

User Authentication: Users can sign up and log in to the application using their credentials. User authentication is handled using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure and efficient user validation.

Create New Posts: Authenticated users can create new posts by providing a recipe name and description. The recipes are stored in the database and associated with the respective user's account.

Side Navigation: The application features a side navigation bar that provides quick access to various sections, such as the user's profile and the option to create new posts.

Profile Page: The profile page displays the username of the currently logged-in user and a personalized greeting message.

Displaying Recipes: The main feed of the application displays all the recipes created by users, allowing users to see and interact with each other's recipes.

Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a consistent user experience across different devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

The project uses modern web development technologies, including React components for modular UI building, Axios for handling API requests, and JWT for secure user authentication. The backend is implemented with Node.js and Express, communicating with the MySQL database for storing and retrieving user information and recipes. The CSS styling provides a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for seamless navigation and recipe sharing.
